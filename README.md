# Project Sentinel: Crypto-TradFi Sentiment Bridge

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%2B-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)

A proof-of-concept application that bridges Traditional Finance (TradFi) and the Crypto ecosystem. It analyzes the market sentiment of the S&P 500 using news headlines and presents it alongside the real-time price of Bitcoin, demonstrating the integration of disparate financial data sources through APIs and AI.

### How It Works ⚙️

The script executes a clear, sequential workflow:

1.  **Fetch TradFi Asset Name**: Connects to the Interactive Brokers API to get the full name of the `SPY` ETF, verifying the connection to a traditional brokerage system.
2.  **Fetch TradFi News**: Queries the NewsAPI for recent articles mentioning the "S&P 500".
3.  **Analyze Sentiment (AI)**: Each news headline is processed by the VADER sentiment analysis model to calculate a sentiment score. The script then computes an average score to gauge the overall market mood.
4.  **Fetch Crypto Price**: Connects to the Kraken exchange API to get the latest price for the `XBT/USD` pair.
5.  **Generate Report**: Displays all the collected and analyzed data in a clean, formatted report in the console.

### Tech Stack 🛠️

* **Language:** Python
* **Core APIs:**
    * [Kraken REST API](https://docs.kraken.com/rest/): For real-time cryptocurrency market data.
    * [Interactive Brokers API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/): For traditional finance asset data.
    * [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/): For fetching financial news headlines.
* **AI / Machine Learning:**
    * **VADER (vaderSentiment):** A lexicon-based sentiment analysis library, perfect for analyzing sentiment in short texts like headlines.
* **Key Python Libraries:**
    * `krakenex`: Official wrapper for the Kraken API.
    * `ib_insync`: A clean, synchronous library for the Interactive Brokers API.
    * `requests`: For making HTTP requests to NewsAPI.
    * `configparser`: For securely managing API keys.

## Disclaimer & Future Work

### 📜 Disclaimer

This project is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) created for educational and demonstrational purposes only. Its primary goal is to showcase the technical integration of APIs from both the Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Crypto ecosystems.

* The data presented by this script is for informational purposes only and should **not** be considered financial advice, investment advice, or a recommendation to buy or sell any asset.
* Market data and news sentiment can be volatile and are subject to change.
* The author makes no guarantees regarding the accuracy of the data or the reliability of the code for production use. Always do your own research (DYOR).

### 🚀 Future Improvements

This project serves as a solid foundation. Several enhancements could be made to evolve it into a more robust tool:

* **Advanced Sentiment Analysis:** Implement a more sophisticated sentiment analysis model, such as a pre-trained transformer like **FinBERT**, for more nuanced and context-aware scoring.
* **Historical Data Analysis:** Store the results in a database (e.g., SQLite or a time-series DB like InfluxDB) to track and visualize the correlation between TradFi market sentiment and Bitcoin's price over time.
* **Expanded Data Sources:** Integrate additional data sources, such as social media sentiment (e.g., Twitter/X API) or key on-chain metrics, to create a more comprehensive market indicator.
* **Web Interface / API:** Refactor the application into a web service using a framework like **Flask** or **FastAPI**. This would allow it to serve the report via an API endpoint or display it on a simple web dashboard.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** For improved performance, rewrite the API calls to be asynchronous using libraries like `aiohttp` and `asyncio`, allowing the script to fetch data from all sources concurrently.
